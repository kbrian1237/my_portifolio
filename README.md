# 💼 Personal Web Portfolio

Welcome to my **personal web portfolio**, a beginner-friendly, clean, and responsive static website created using **pure HTML**. This project is designed not only as a presentation of who I am, but also as a **learning tool** that documents my journey into front-end web development.

---

## 📚 Project Overview

This portfolio consists of three primary HTML files:

- `index.html`: The **landing page** and entry point of the website.
- `about.html`: A personal **biography page** where I share background info about myself.
- `learn_html.html`: A **learning log** page that explains basic HTML concepts and documents what I’ve learned.

The entire site is built without frameworks or libraries, to solidify my foundational knowledge in **HTML and CSS**.
